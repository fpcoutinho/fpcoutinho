# Hi, there! :wave:

I am Filipe Coutinho, a Computer Science undergrad student from Patos, Para√≠ba.<br> 
I've been living in Jo√£o Pessoa, capital of Para√≠ba for 6 years, where, amongs many things, I've been studying Computer Science at the Federal University of Para√≠ba ([UFPB](http://www.ci.ufpb.br/)).<br>
Currently, I'm enrolled in the final semester of the bachelor's program, and I'm working as a Trainee in the Front End Architecture and Platform team at [Mercado Bitcoin](https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br/quem-somos).<br>
In the past, I had the oppotunity to spend two semesters of my graduation studying abroad at [Siena College](https://www.siena.edu/).<br>
An interesting fact about me is that I have two cats, and during my years at UFPB I, together with a group of friends, was a co-founder of a students group for the protection of the stray animals abandoned on campus üêà‚Äç‚¨õüêï<br>
