# Hi, there!

I am Filipe Coutinho, a Software Engineer from Patos, Paraíba.<br> 
I've been living in João Pessoa, capital of Paraíba for 6 years, where, amongst many things, I've studied Computer Science at the Federal University of Paraíba ([UFPB](http://www.ci.ufpb.br/)).<br>
Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer in the Front End Architecture and Platform team at [Mercado Bitcoin](https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br/quem-somos), where I've mostly been responsible for the building, testing and documentation of our Design System: Atmosfera.<br>
In the past, I had the opportunity to spend two semesters of my graduation studying abroad at [Siena College](https://www.siena.edu/).<br>
I'm a proud tutor of two little cats 🐈‍⬛🐕, who are called Appa and Mushu.<br>
And an interesting fact about me is that during my years at UFPB I helped co-found a student group for the protection of the stray animals on campus.<br>
